# "Coaching App"

### Website Purpose
This site will be used to catalog links and updates on the progress of the "Coaching App" for Todd Melton.

## Team Introduction
### [Justin Lisoway](https://justinlisoway.github.io/):
I worked one internship in mobile app development as a product tester, and I had continuous communication with the development team. My background is not in CS, but I am in the MS CS program and am developing my software engineering skills. I am familiar with MongoDB, JS, Java, and Python, and I am in a mobile app development class now learning Flutter and Dart.

## Project Overview

In this project, I aim to develop a mobile application for my former swim club. This application will have two different types of users: the coach, and the swimmer.

The first client group (coach) will have a survey screen and a workouts screen. In the survey screen, they can send a new survey to every swimmer, and view past survey data. In the workouts screen, they can view past workouts with metrics (distance, intensity, and duration), view the current workout, and update the current workout for all swimmers to see.

The second group (swimmers) will have a survey screen and a workoutscreen. The survey screen either shows a new unfilled survey, or a message saying they have no new surveys. The workouts screen shows only the current workout.

My techstack will include flutter for frontend and Firebase data management for the backend. I will use the Agile methodology for development with bi-weekly sprints. Each Sprint will conclude with a version of the app that can Demo newly implemented features.

Personally, I have swam competitively for 17 years, the last 7 of which have been scraping at the highest level of competition. Due to this history, I can effectively communicate with the client about the issues he is facing, because I can understand better than other developers the exact problems he is trying to solve. This is an exciting project, because I am able to use over a decade of experience on a topic to create a software product that the vast majority of other developers would have a hard time effectively implementing.

## Sponsor Information

Sponsor: Todd Melton

Mr. Melton is my former swim coach that I will be meeting with on a regular basis to show updates on the app and get continuous feedback. He coached at the Okotoks Mavericks Swim Club for 11 years while I was there and has since started his own online coaching enterprise, which will eventually involve the technology that I am creating for him. He coaches many athletes remotely, and currently lacks a way to efficiently communicate with all of them about their recovery and workouts. Current forms of similar software do not implement “swimming” related metrics. The overarching goal of my app is to fill this need and allow Todd to efficiently send surveys and workouts to all of his swimmers.

## Success Criteria

By the end of the semester, I must deliver an MVP that:

1. Allows a coach to post a swimming workout
2. Allows a group of swimmers to view a swimming workout posted by a coach
3. Allows a coach to survey their athletes on recovery metrics

## Milestones

### Milestone 1: Define User stories, and specify priorities. (October 7)
### Milestone 2: Organize project website and github workflow with a backlog of user stories. (October 7)
### Milestone 3: Wire Framing (October 21)
### Milestone 4: Mockups of all application pages (November 4)
### Milestone 5: Create databases and integrate into mockup pages (November 18)
### Milestone 6: Define User Roles and User authentication using Firebase (November 25)
### Milestone 7: Test Success criteria. Deliver Prototype to the client to test with his athletes (December 2)
### Final Milestone: Continue improving the design of the app based on any client test feedback (End of Semester)

## Usage

Following Milestone 4, this section will include screenshots of the app's current version with breif text describing its function.

## Repository

[Newest Repository](https://github.com/Coaching-Software/app)

To run this code, clone the main branch of the repository to your local machine and invoke 'flutter run' on the app directory. You may also need to first install flutter and get dependencies (this can be done easily with intelliJ). Note: app is currently mocked-up to look best on the XCODE iOS iPhone 14 simulator.
